        <center><h2>Thursday February 20, 2025</h2></center><br>
           Still a bit shakey after a job interview. I think it went well, but what I think doesn't really matter here.<BR>
            Thought writing may help calm my nerves. If this doesn't do the trick, then maybe a good meal and a strong drink this evening---to celebrate if anything.<Br>
              ya know, just the fact that Columbia was interested in me based on my resume means something. I've worked really hard to get where I am today, and that interview made me feel seen in a sense.<BR>
                <BR>
                  Anyways, its good to be home. Feeling invigorated after a less than helpful visit to Ohio. It was just cold and I was bored. I missed my personal space here in the city.<BR>
                    Also just didn't care to see all the people I used to hang out with. I blend in better here. I feel less noticed.<BR>
                      Although I wouldn't mind being noticed by a cutie sometime <img src="images/shrug.gif"><BR>
                        I should focus more on building this site.<BR><BR>
                          I really like this Danny Brown lyric:<BR>
                            <i>Nowhere to go when they telling you no when there's nowhere to go where we gon' end up</i><BR><BR><BR>
                              <center>Have you noticed the increase in text styling??<BR>
                              I've been practicing</center><BR><BR><BR>
                                I really want to make this website a gif archive....but it in the most natural way possible, and it must be done tastefully.<BR>
                                  Sounds like a pretty cool challenge. I love finding weird gifs and mispelling everything------ you should see my code<BR><BR><BR>
                                    <a href="/blushing.html"> a page I made for when I need to express guilt via the web</a>
                                    Its one of those nights where its so cold, you kinda jog home from the bar.<BR>
                                      <center>(speaking of which, i made friends over videogame soundtracks. gotta go back next week and give some more requests. also made friends with a fellow librarian!)</center><br><BR><BR><BR><BR>
                                        I made an online dating profile for fun. Cause I'm now confident enough to not care about what randos think of me. Anyways, I'm 32???? Uh really been saying I'm 31 still?<BR><BR><BR><BR>I listened to, and almost completely sang, the entire <a href="/images/th-575921782.jpg">Neverhood</a>soundtrack. And also made this image as my desktop background because it used to scare me as a child<BR><BR>Also just like the idea of "preserving" this piece of media. I hope in 100 years from now someone...or thing can decipher my code and understand what information I'm trying to share.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
                                          <center>my robot boyfriend will be able to <s>read</s> understand
                                          because is this not like the most vunderable writing I have ever done?.....~my holistic coding practices~ so natural not even a machine can understand.
                                        At least in a way that I don't mind it being read some day.<BR><BR>
                                        I burn everything I find too.....cringe...to ever read again.<BR><BR>
                                        I need to read through this website and delete some shit for sure....or stop smoking weed</center><BR><BR><BR>

        <center><h2>Tuesday February 18, 2025</h2></center><br>
            I've always appriciated authors who reference other literary works within their own. It makes me go "I should read that next." And I love when I go "I should read that next." I've got a few titles that Vonnegut mentioned in various parts of Palm Sunday.<BR><BR>
            So it got me to thinkin' about what literary works I'd reference in my work. I am trying to make note of these now. I like that I can detect literary techniques (did I spell that right? is that what this is called?) because then it makes it easy to apply what I like to read, to what I write.<BR><BR>
            <center>I can sorta emulate  my favortite writers</center><br><BR>
            All of this just to introduce the first instance of my ability to emulate my favorite writer, Vonnegut.<BR>
            <BR>The first Vonnegut novel (or book for that matter) was <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> for my sophmore summer reading in high school.<BR>
            Really the only thing I remember about that book is a car salesman named like...."Dwight?" lol. And Kilgore Trout describing the condition of his feet after he treked through some chemical run-off infested river as he sat in a crowd at some event.<BR>
            The polluted river water coverd his feet in some hard plastic. For some reason, I have always refered to this anytime I talk to someone about my feet. Its so strange honestly. I am not even sure I am getting the story right.<BR>
            So I should probably re-read <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> just to make sure I got my facts straight. The way Vonnegut described Trout's feet in the book, left me with this feeling of "this guys has some experience with feet".....or something.<br><BR><BR><BR>
            <B>Well anyways, its nice to be back to writing</B>
