Time unknown
Started crochet snowflakes. My abilites have gone to seed, I struggle to recreate familiar patterns. But Nicole said even the simple patterns could fool a layman. Made about half a dozen of the same pattern in different colorways. The "Snowflake Recipients" list grows every year. Need too make at least 18 this year. Halfway there.

Listen to the Toonami soundtrack(?). I was never a fan of Toonami, so I have no idea how it relates to the songs. Recently, it has been my stretching soundtrack.

Maybe I will start releasing entries in batches. The last thing I want to do after writing is update the site. Although, it is much easiier now. We'll see. My disjointed, long-winded, screeds are becoming annoying. A long way to go to create a respectable website...if ever. I like it kinda trashy. In the meantime, I should create a collection of images of my crochet pieces.

I should continue computer-journaling, but  refrain from posting every little thing. Be more prudent over what should and shouldn't be shared.

Well anyways, the plan was to muse on relationshipss while stretching, but I am kinda over it now.

2:24pm
Feeling off today, at least physically. Shakey, dizzy, ringing, vision disturbances.
Unfortunate, because its unseasonablely warm today. Its been some time since I went on a walk.
But I need to rest now. Maybe finish Secret Rendezvous.

8:32pm
Eating baby carrots.
Finding the good in the garbage.
I wish I had more female friendships growing up. I've got a few now, and hearing the crazy shit they do, makes me feel more normal.
I hope I can impart some wisdom. It's so performative when a woman frequently verbalizes her dissatisfaction with men, but continues to pander for the male validation.
Showing some love to these women, as a woman, will develop their ability to see through bullshit. And understand that the people who genuinely love you,
would never treat you like this man does. Time to stop showing up to his work unannounced.
I empathize with you, but why are you doing this? 
I was down bad when my last situationship ended. Although I believe I acted crazy, I also agree this woman acted crazier than me.
Good for me I guess.

I've been reflecting on my relationship with my computer. She's my girl, but I don't do a damn thing to make her life easier.
I enabled File History, whatever that is. I think it wil backup all my files...somewhere.
Six years of data here. Some good stuff. I need clear up some space.

Maybe I do say "fuck it" and style a slip to be  Christmas party appropriate.
Or pray the red embroidered floor length 90s gown fits and be overdressed.
I do appriciate a well-styled slip. I maintian decorum by wearing my skimpiest, without sacrificing decency, base layer with lots
and lots of layers overtop. I like peeling off layers only to reapply them moments later.
I like when my movements make me standout. Don't need to say a word.
You may yearn, but do it over there and don't talk to me. Just observe for a bit before diving in. You're exhausting. Thank you.

Still not feeling well. Dizzy, nauseous, head pressure, vision disturbances, body temp oscilating.
I'm apprehensive to stand up.
Spent too much time trying to download my browsing history. Google Takeout was not the solution. I will have to continue transfering this data by hand.
From one device to another.
Your bestie/housemate/landlord, emits a strange gutteral snort when she eats. You sleep on her office floor.
She eats at her desk while working. You don your embarssingly large headphones and throw on some Popol Vuh to drown out the noise.
The noises today are particularly grating since you are infirmed.
If things don't improve within the next couple days, you should see a doctor.
Although, being admitted, once again, terrifies you. The ER is hell.

My writiing sound much better in second person. I've only realized this after reading the work of a friend. He used second person to retell his life stories.
I hate the words "I, me, mine, my" etc. Nearly everything I have written is in first person, and it's kinda cringe.
You could say his writing inspired me to try something different. I ended up really liking it.
Would an abrupt change in perspective be strange this late in the game? Guess its some sort of sunk cost fallacy or whatever. 
I think the solution is to keep rambling and streaming my conciousness here, and post the more interesting stuff on another page.
I think I might start by describing my morning shower routine. Maybe my research into the Dubs Guy/"Check 'Em" meme has permeated my subconcious.
Or maybe because I never really had a well-defined morning routine. Now that I do, I find it interesting. Provide unncessecary, but interesting, info about me.

10:45pm
Up later than expected, writing out my morning routine. It's much longer than I imagined. I was kinda riffing off Patrick Bateman going into this, but 
it has evovled into it own beast. I thought it would be short, as I consider myself a more minimalist Bateman, but a lot more than I thought goes into my morning routine.
Luckily, I adore my morning routine and look forward to it so the preceeding night.

353pm
Listening to Popol Vuh and crocheting snowflakes.
Checked-out a few books on HTML and CSS from the library. After a year of winging it on the back of prior knowledge from the MySpace days, I'm either comfortable enough to
learn, or fed up enough with how lousey this site is.
Either or, I've found something new to learn that is practical.
Opposed to all the studying I've done on calthestenics, yet couldn't name one exercise. Its usually all theory for me.

9:09pm
Atleast I can say I am working on a few writing projects. No titles yet, but content includes my morning routine, Thanksgiving memories, and a scathing review of a friends art.
I'll keep the review to myself unless someone inquires for my opion on the piece.
Its mostly an exercise in making respectful and intelligent arguments. Knowing that anyone can hate you at anytime, nevermind what it is, they will still call you a bitch.
I'm down to accept my strong personality as part of me now.
Kinda tired of fighting it.

I hope to publish(?) the other two here.
Probably let other people read them. Unlike this website, which only a haphazardly slected few have the "code" to get here.

I need to get back to writing about Thanksgiving.

My other projects: crochet snowflakes, learn to draw horses, oil pastels, studying HTML & CSS, writing letters, baking, reading.

I worte the incorrect date on all my medical forms today.
Hell of a psych appointment.
The jury (me) has reached a verdict in the "Big Bag, Bad Bag?" case.
And we hate the Big Bag
The smoking gun was the fiinal piece of evidence.
It's a black hole and this act of rumagging  feels performative.
Yes, it is extremely embarssing.
So why not make it apart of me?
It's better not to fight it.
Unfortunately, this is not the bit for me.
I find it too frustrating for myself.
This is a simple frutration to fix.
And I will, eventually.
So add this to the list.
"Evaluate bags and note thier organizational abilities."
"Asseses wants and needs of items in bag. Make it easier to swap bags."

I believe I came here to write something else.
But I cannot remember.
I'll move onto the next task.

But kinda feel like task lists are limiting.
I'd like to organize by importance, but difficult to do with this app.
Maybe I should go back to pen and paper.

Herzog's Nosferatu Soundtrack on repeat.
Next Halloween I am going to watch every rendition.
Or just start tonight.
I'll write it on a post-it.
I haven't completely consumed any TV or movies in some time.
Thinking of the last movie I watched, I think that Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen flick. 
Badlands! I liked that one.
And before that..one with the guy who plays Hawkeye in M*A*S*H.
Donald Sutherland. The kinda guy with a seaperate Wikipedia record for his filmography. 
It was "Don't Look Now." I really don't remember it.
I should also watch Altman's M*A*S*H.
I loved Spacek and Duvall in 3 Women.
What's the name of that hard to find Altman flick...
Theives Like Us. I need to watch it. Shelley is in it.

I am sunsetting the AFI 100 Greatest Movies project.
I prefer serendipity. Discovering films during my pesuits.

I tend to assume all lists are heirarchical.
I hope I am wrong to assume in the case.
I librarian position - the first responsibility listed, in multiple loications - "sort and distribute mail" - seems strange. 

Even in captivity they are free.
The Enya isn't making this any less emotional
