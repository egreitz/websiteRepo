Left hand over head, to stifle the bloodflow.
Rifle through a box of various bathroom essentials.
Sometimes you keep bandaids in your bathroom, right?
Well you put them in the kitchen.
That's what you were raised on.
Bandaids in the kitchen.
You fish out a mixed bag of bandages.
You start to wonder "what IS my favorite type of bandaid though?"
You wish to say cloth, and you certainly convinved youself, but you're not sure why.
You commit to noticing the bandaid, take note of what you think about the bandaid.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're still furiously plucking bandages from the heap of other bathroom essentioals.
Boxes of soap, a hoard of tretinion, individual razor blades wrapped in waxy evelopes.
A large cloth bandaid. This must be what you're looking for.
You would settle for a small cloth bandaid or two, which you have.
But you certainly won't settle for a large plastic bandage, which you also have.
-------------eponym or genertic terms?------------
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<eyponym is a good pet name.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
So the large cloth bandiad is what you were looking for, and found.
You blot the leision, preparing for a swift bandage application.
Dab, dab, dab
You hurry to peel apart the protective sleeve
Okay now the plastic tabs.
You make quick glances to watch the blood pool under the layer of the partially attached skin severed from you finger.
No sense in turning back now, you will see this through.
Done.
You sink your hips towards the ground and release your feet from under you.
Criss-cross applesauce, you give the bandaid a look-see.
Good enough, but you wish you had sliced the finger with the broken nail.
---------------------------------------------------------------
You really fell into it
The eyes of potatoes.
Usually your mother gouges them.
This time the eyes remain.
Some people don't miind the eyes, unlike your mother.
Even after boiling and smashing, she inspects the vats for any eyes that managed to make it this far.
Each year there are fewer eyes in the vats.
Mother has allowed me to gouge out a few eyes under her watchful eye.
There's nothing mother hates more than a poorly peeled potato.
Each year more tedious than the last.
The family history you earnestly revealed to a friend.
Convinced it's an entertaining story, you refuse to delay and begin to write.
And thinking about things a bit deeper.
With poetic prose
Your eyes locked, you and the potato
One man's mundane is another man's fascination.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You awake early, as you do with any holiday, truely any.
Newspaper extends, wafting the powdered air
Aroma of day old black coffee
Sounds and scents present dawn of a new day
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You find the ritual of reheating day old coffee a bit less strange than the one before.
A stop at McDonald's, everday, for a large black coffee.
Transcluesent red Pizza Hut cups, full of coffee, scattered around the fridge, sometimes covered with a piece of flimsy cellophane.
The balancing act performeed to navigate the fridge, to not distrub the red cups of drive-thru coffee.
Might explain some things.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comfort in knowing what lies ahead.
Its a holiday with traditions.
With fufilled expectations.
