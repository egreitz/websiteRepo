            <p>Trying to get into my old MacBook again. Got the scans of <a href="/images/CCF02042023_0001-01.jpg">old Valentine's Day cards</a>. These are from my moms classmates in middle school. Estimated date would be early 1970's.</p>

            <p>Neglected to mention the program a friend wrote for me to log my daily readings and listenings. It will live at the top of this page.</p>

            <p>I hope to dedicate this time away to editing.</p>

                  <p>Like sparrows in the dust. Wings spread not to vacate the placid ground below, but to lie in and agitate. Dislocate the foundation, floating in the air, only to settle in one's own wings, to carry from that moment forward.
                    Surface dust dislodged with a good preen, but skin remains mottled and smothered. Absorbing oil, obstructing parasites. The dust protects.

                    <p>I lie beneath the veil of poverty and misfortune.</p>

                                  <p>Been some time again. Book Thing today. Crossed paths with an old, what's a good word, fling? I hate that word, but it will do.</p>
                  Opposing the point of this log and will not dive into thoughts.                    Had a friend visit this weekend. Was pleasant.                  <h3><a href="images/bookThing08102025.jpg">Book Thing finds</a></h3>
                    Crossed four books off my list [McCullers, Heller, Percy, and Abe] impulsed picked up Capote and Lawrence. Replacing my ugly <i>Woman on the Edge of Time</i> copy with this pocket paperback.</p>
                   Deciding between <I>Love in the Ruins</I>, <i>The Woman in the Dunes</i>, and <i>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</i>                      Reading author bios and am drawn to Walker Percy:                      "I was the happiest man ever to contract tuberculosis, because it enabled me to get out of Bellevue and quit medicine."                                                Looking into <i>Something Happened</i>. Coporate dehumanization of the employee would be relevant, but maybe too much so.                          I started <i>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</i>. Captivating so far.</p>
