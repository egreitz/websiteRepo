        Dropped my guitar off at the music shop to get new strings. My attempt ended in a broken string, and I don't mind play a local guy to do it for me. I also didn't even cry when I broke the string.<BR>
          I really wanted to play with the new nylon strings, but now I will have a nicely stringed and tuned guitar by Friday.<BR><BR>
            I am so tired. Its difficult to sleep in my apartment. I am considering book a hotel room for a couple nights just to rest.

       Been having a lot of sleep for dinner lately. Picked the guitar back up, been listening to a lot of T. Rex. Accepting the fact that my career is all I have at the moment.
       And if it wants to take me to Princeton, then to Princeton I go. Maybe I don't need to be buying a home. If I want security, I am going to have to find something to secure myself to.<BR>
        If I am going to do this alone, I am going to need more money.

        Things haven't been the same since that week I listened to Pet Sounds every day.

        Conference was fine. A man said my website "isn't a website".<BR><BR>
        Happy to be home.<BR>

            Let me tell you about the time I spent $11.00 on two tubs [?] jars [?] of protien powder and how thats my dinner to maintain my weight so I can fit into my fine vintage clothing.<BR><BR>
            What's your favorite depression era-esque meal? Like butter toast with cinnamon sugar.<BR><BR>
              Its how I maintain my figure.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Okay I gotta make some art or something to counter-balance these garbage thoughts.<BR><BR>
                I like to consume media about technology that is now seemlessly ingrained into our lives....like Gary Numan's 1979 song "Cars"

            One day I'm gonna write the most beautiful love letter. You wouldn't be able to tell based on what you read here (and good cause you shouldn't!) But I know its gonna happen one day.<BR>
              Maybe it already has.....I began reading a short love letter left behind by the man I was seeing in Dresden. I read til the end, but it left me feeling strange. The things he said in that letter, why couldn't I believe them then, as I do now?<BR>
                It left me feeling somewhat surprised, that someone had said such lovely things about me at one time. At a time, that I believed for so long, in which I was undeserving of such kindness.<BR><BR>
                  I have many many love letters, I had never ever reread any of them before tonight.<br>
                  One day I will reread all them and allow myself to love the person I was then, thru the words of the people who loved me.

          I see it says "WINTER DRESS", but its for 1800, and a basic ==weather in paris 1800== query has me believing it was pretty warm there. According to metro-paris.com "<B>Major weather events of the year 1800:</B> Storage(sic), flash flood, Heat wave and heat wave, cold wave<BR><BR>
