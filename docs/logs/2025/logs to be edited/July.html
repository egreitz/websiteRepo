        Oops it has been two weeks. Been reading a lot and fucking up at work.<br><BR>
          I am tired of working. I don't want money. I want simple living.<BR>
        Just need to make it one more year here.<BR><BR>
          I should find a less stressful job.<BR>
            I think Trailer Park Boys has had an outright influence on current fashion trends<BR>

                my skin and hair is far too flawed to ever think I deserve love<BR><BR>
                  I went to yoga and read two chapters of the Brothers today.<BR>
                3 am approached sooner than sleep last night. Today I awoke at 11am. A waste of a day. I need the rest.<BR>
                I cannot balance the drive to create with the requirements to attain money.<BR>
                  I need to return home, care for my family, and hope, if the "best scenario" exsists, to love and have my own family.<BR>
                  Love not find me here or at home. Wherever love may be, I will not find.<BR><BR>
                  Fulfillment, as a person of my lineage, is found in the family.<BR><BR>

                    There is a man at the bar, who also works at the  bar, (the layers) who has piqued my interest.<BR>
                    Emboldened that I may leave here in one year's time. Perhaps I may, with my lacerated skin and coarse hair, find love, if only momentarily. If only for one night. Please if only for a few hours. 
                      <BR><BR>I need to get home to my mother and take care of her. Can I last another year?<BR><BR>
                        To think, not so long ago, in a moment of distress, which is a moment often: I confided in a dear friend "Moving back to Kent is not an option."
<BR>
                  Yet I have been mollified. I will move back to Kent. If it will afford me more time to sit in the grass and read.
                  Solace is found in the unknown. To know that you, the reader, only know what I share here. My mind filtered.<BR>

            I need distractions, but hate the possibilities.<BR>
              I spend so much time, not soothing, but distracting from the pain. It is not an enjoyment, but necessary to live.<BR>
              Hopes to be distracted long enough to persue enjoyment.<BR><BR>

                "Or maybe," I always think, "all these people, feel the same"<BR>
                  So why is it so hard for me? What am I missing?????<BR><BR>

        The pleasure of coming home only to realize I forgot to turn off the AC is far greater than the money saved doing the oppopsite.<BR><BR>
        Started writing my work self-evaluation. Might even become good enough to share here.<BR><BR>
        I'd like to use my new cardio/yoga routine to listen to full albums. One running album, one yoga album. Been pleased with "The Downward Spiral" for running. Tried "Pet Sounds" for yoga -- not sure on this, but I like that its whistle-able.<BR>
          Once I select appropriate albums (as I have with TDS) I would like to rearrange it to suit the workout. For example, "Piggy" would be a good warm up track. "Ruiner" for cool down.<BR><BR>
            <BR>
              Anyways, I watched Hiroshima Mon Amor last night. Beautiful movie. Eager to listen to Professor Dreyfus' lecture on it.<BR><BR>
                Learning ignites desire to subjugate. Someone will read me, even if its thru a self-evaluation.<BR><BR>

                      "Erratic" to be described as by a man, who I have spoken with - at length- no more than twice, has infected my mind.<BR>
                        A first in adjectives bestowed upon me by a man.<BR><BR>
                          I asked "do you mean 'mysterious'"?(an adjective I am most familiar with)<BR><BR>
                            "No, erratic" he said. And created a sweeping gesture at me, to signify my current state as jsutification (three martinis deep, wearing a too revealing of a top [what I would derive as my most erratic traits of the night]) <BR><BR>
                              Lest we forget, his past fortune with women, which I would describe it as "undesirable."<BR>
                                Even so, lest we forget that I have only spoken to this man, perhaps twice?<BR><BR>
                                  I cannot believe that our descriptions of each other are accurate.<br>
                                  To be able to have such a definite description of me is...concerning.<BR><BR><BR>

    Worked from home. Laundry. Went to the park.<BR><BR>
    The CDs that once belonged to my mom are very sentimental. I don't believe my copy of "God Shuffled His Feet" was ever in her possesion, although it has been persistent my entire life. I must have found my copy at the thrift store.<BR>
      I have her copy of "Red Rose Speedway". Its some European pressing which I think is neat. Knowing this, "Red Rose Speedway" has more weight than "God Shuffled His Feet", the skipping and scratches give more character.<BR><BR>
        All that to say, I was REAL disappointed to find <u>two</u> copies of Fall Out Boy's first album [so ticked idec to remember the name] in the "Flaming Pie" case. No idea where the "Flaming Pie" CD is. <BR>
          Unfortunate because it was mom's. It has remaind in my collection even through middle and high school. McCartney lifer I suppose. I haven't listened to the album since high school --- dreams of walking down the aisle to Calico Skies, even more demented to learn to play myself---<BR><br>
            I want to see if it holds up now. I will have to track down a new copy.<BR><BR>
            I don't want to become complacent and solely rely on streaming services for music. Streaming is when you wanna listen to Neil Young or Henry Mancini.<BR><BR><BR>
              Gotta get the CD if you wanna listen to music the way God intended.<BR><BR>
                <BR>
              A man notified me that it was clear to cross the street, even on a hand. I thanked him. I wondered "Would his motive bestow validation?" Probably better not to think about. [[He wasn't even cute]]<BR><BR>
              Comforts are a prison.<BR>
              No matter how, it is important to capture thoughts<BR><BR>

                Cover songs by Nine Inch Nails are very funny.<BR><BR>

      Practicing CSS today. Realized that grouping logs by months and moving them to their own page breaks all the image links. I am sure there is an easy solution.<BR>
      images are in website>images<BR>
      monthly log files for 2025 are in website>2025log. Just have to go back a directory or two. But I would still have to edit every image link.<BR>
      I'll have to sleep on it.<BR><BR>
      Gonna practice CSS on my current logs. I want my site to look a little cleaner. Ready to actually learn something from all this.
    
      Moving photos from my phone to my computer. Fun to take a look back.<BR>
    Think I accomplished a lot in 2 hours. Look how cute this page is.<BR><BR>
      Stuck on getting this giant image small, without changing the "home" icon in the nav bar.
      I know it has something to do with classes or ids, but I can't get them talkin to each other.<BR><BR>
        I get back to it later. Its 10:56pm
    <center>       <img class="chair" src="images/art/chairPlants.JPG"/><BR>
      I need to do this more often</center>
