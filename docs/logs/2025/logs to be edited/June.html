        I need distractions, but hate the possibilities.<BR>
          I spend so much time, not soothing, but distracting from the pain. It is not an enjoyment, but necessary to live.<BR>
          Hopes to be distracted long enough to persue enjoyment.<BR><BR>

            "Or maybe," I always think, "all these people, feel the same"<BR>

                Health anxiety is maxed out today. One spot, in particular, on my spine is causing a lot of discomfort.<BR>

    The pleasure of coming home only to realize I forgot to turn off the AC is far greater than the money saved doing the oppopsite.<BR><BR>
    Started writing my work self-evaluation. Might even become good enough to share here.<BR><BR>
    I'd like to use my new cardio/yoga routine to listen to full albums. One running album, one yoga album. Been pleased with "The Downward Spiral" for running. Tried "Pet Sounds" for yoga -- not sure on this, but I like that its whistle-able.<BR>
      Once I select appropriate albums (as I have with TDS) I would like to rearrange it to suit the workout. For example, "Piggy" would be a good warm up track. "Ruiner" for cool down.<BR><BR>
        <BR>
          Anyways, I watched Hiroshima Mon Amor last night. Beautiful movie. Eager to listen to Professor Dreyfus' lecture on it.<BR><BR>
            Learning ignites desire to subjugate. Someone will read me, even if its thru a self-evaluation.<BR><BR>
            <p class="time">7:17pm</p>
              I believe my skin is perfectly sunkissed. Did not wait nearly as long as I assumed. Keep this in mind next March, when you are lamenting your pallor.<BR><BR>
                <p class="time">12:16am</p>
                  "Erratic" to be described as by a man, who I have spoken with - at length- no more than twice, has infected my mind.<BR>
                    A first in adjectives bestowed upon me by a man.<BR><BR>
                      I asked "do you mean 'mysterious'"?(an adjective I am most familiar with)<BR><BR>
                        "No, erratic" he said. And created a sweeping gesture at me, to signify my current state as jsutification (three martinis deep, wearing a too revealing of a top [what I would derive as my most erratic traits of the night]) <BR><BR>
                          I have only spoken to this man, perhaps twice?<BR><BR>
                              I cannot believe that our descriptions of each other are accurate.<br>
                              To be able to have such a definite description of me is...concerning.<BR><BR><BR>

Worked from home. Laundry. Went to the park.<BR><BR>
The CDs that once belonged to my mom are very sentimental. I don't believe my copy of "God Shuffled His Feet" was ever in her possesion, although it has been persistent my entire life. I must have found my copy at the thrift store.<BR>
  I have her copy of "Red Rose Speedway". Its some European pressing which I think is neat. Knowing this, "Red Rose Speedway" has more weight than "God Shuffled His Feet", the skipping and scratches give more character.<BR><BR>
    All that to say, I was REAL disappointed to find <u>two</u> copies of Fall Out Boy's first album [so ticked idec to remember the name] in the "Flaming Pie" case. No idea where the "Flaming Pie" CD is. <BR>
      Unfortunate because it was mom's. It has remaind in my collection even through middle and high school. McCartney lifer I suppose. I haven't listened to the album since high school --- dreams of walking down the aisle to Calico Skies, even more demented to learn to play myself---<BR><br>
        I want to see if it holds up now. I will have to track down a new copy.<BR><BR>
        I don't want to become complacent and solely rely on streaming services for music. Streaming is when you wanna listen to Neil Young or Henry Mancini.<BR><BR><BR>
          Gotta get the CD if you wanna listen to music the way God intended.<BR><BR>
            <BR>
          A man notified me that it was clear to cross the street, even on a hand. I thanked him. I wondered "Would his motive bestow validation?" Probably better not to think about. [[He wasn't even cute]]<BR><BR>
          Comforts are a prison.<BR>
          No matter how, it is important to capture thoughts<BR><BR>

            Cover songs by Nine Inch Nails are very funny.<BR><BR>

Finding a lot of value in this independent studying. How should I refrain from regret when life once lacked such simple pleasures?<BR>
  I am feeling...fufilled. The lack of love becomes...sentimental. A retreat. An enduring hope. I've been doing well -- smothering my hopped-up impulses.<BR>

  Maybe I should make these post less...creative.<BR><BR>
  Practicing CSS today. Realized that grouping logs by months and moving them to their own page breaks all the image links. I am sure there is an easy solution.<BR>
  images are in website>images<BR>
  monthly log files for 2025 are in website>2025log. Just have to go back a directory or two. But I would still have to edit every image link.<BR>
  I'll have to sleep on it.<BR><BR>
  Gonna practice CSS on my current logs. I want my site to look a little cleaner. Ready to actually learn something from all this.

  Moving photos from my phone to my computer. Fun to take a look back.<BR>
Think I accomplished a lot in 2 hours. Look how cute this page is.<BR><BR>
  Stuck on getting this giant image small, without changing the "home" icon in the nav bar.
  I know it has something to do with classes or ids, but I can't get them talkin to each other.<BR><BR>
