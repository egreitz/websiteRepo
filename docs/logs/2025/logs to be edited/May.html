                <p>Saw that Catbird today.<BR>
                  I wanna use "belletrist" in my writing, but idk what it is really yet.<BR><BR>
                  Wurthering Heights has been my morning entertainment. Saturday mornings are a bit too busy for me.<BR> A man was passed out at the park while is phone, propped up on his backpack, screamed commericals at the park-goers.<BR><BR>
                  The moment moved me so negatively , that I decided to move to another spot. Sunny and quiet.<BR><BR>
                    I need a scribe. Thoughts escape like fish. I never even liked holding fish;; why are they so sharp? Maybe my thoughts are sharp too, can  hardly even touch 'em.<BR><BR>
                      I need one of those fish holding boys. Bet they could hold on to my thoughts for me.<BR><BR><BR>
                        <center>I really wanted to form a conclusion, or at least begin to draw <i>*searches "similarities synonym"*</i> parallels, between those who go to the men's club up the street and those who stop in the middle of the zebra stripes.</center><BR>
                          But I am too tired.<BR><BR>
                          
                          I am going to test/practice some CSS on <a class="nav" href="/2025log/April.html">the April 2025 log</a><BR>
                          Unsatisfied with the look of my site, but I stole most of the code so idk what anything is.<BR> Trying to figure out how to move the log text ot the right a bit more.</p>
                        <BR><BR><BR>
                          Made some really good drip coffee. I was tired of stressin over getting expensive beans from a coffee shop I don't even really like, and then grinding said beans. It was all too much.<BR><BR>
                            So I found an inexpensive brand at the market: Cafe Du Monde from NOLA. Comes in a cute sealed tin can, navy blue and gold, with a plastic lid.<BR>
                          Black in the morning, and with cocoa powder, cardamom, and a teaspoon of vanilla ice cream for an after lunch treat.

          Site is back!<BR>
            A reminder to avoid work on my personal computer. I wanted to try out Collection Builder with a historical dentistry collection, and saved it to this directory...oops.<BR>
            Saw a Catbird today.

            Its been some time, but the feeling and the reality don't agree. Only 26 days. Thats not to assume I have not been thinking about this site every single day<BR>
              Soon I will fix the issues.<BR>
                At least I am still writing.<br><BR>
                I am having a time.<BR><BR>
                  Listening to: Beach Boys, the Kinks, Steely Dan, Lost Highway soundtrack ---- need more Peanuts music and jazz.<BR>
                    I like these lyrics<BR><BR>
                      <center>The little man who gets the train
                        Got a mortgage hangin' over his head
                        But he's too scared to complain
                        'Cause he's conditioned that way
                        </center><BR>
                          Davies, Ray , songwriter. "Shang-ri La" <i>Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)</i>, by The Kinks. Pye, 1969.<BR><BR><BR>
                          An internal Beatles break-up. Ready to settle down and start a family on a farm and sing about it.<BR><BR>
                            I just want to romanticize something.<BR><BR><BR>
                          Growing up I always though the Kinks sang My Sherona, but you really can't blame me.<BR><BR>
                          <BR><BR>
                            Look up: art produced posthumously<BR><BR>
                              Today I learned to spell coincidence. Cooperative incidences. Those morphology lessons coming in hand! Maybe I should go to school for computational lingusitics.....<BR><BR><BR>
                                Thinking about getting an iPhone cause my mom has one. Would make sharing photos with her easier. <BR><BR><BR>
                                  Also buy Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band ---- yt only has the "(Remix)" version and its terrible. So bassy.

                What I write becomes what I type....now,<BR>
<BR>
                But no back tracking, if I decide to type. I need to include something I write. What do I have today?<BR><BR>
                  <center><b><u>Think About:</u></b>
                  *Flower Mart (or any event that takes place in the park for that matter.)<BR>
                  *All this work making me creative<BR>
                  *A man told me I am a good writer<BR><BR>

                  The only significant phsyical quality of a man, is his hands. Hands tell what instrument they play.<BR><BR><BR>
                    I cannot stop thinking about strange lookin man playing violin in the park yesterday. Hardly a looker, but that musical talent,<BR>
                      And the confidence to play (what I assume to be[I was on the phone]) beautiful music in front of unexpecting strangers.<BR>
                      It was....enough for me to sustain eye contact.<BR><BR>
                        Quite a shame I was on my phone. <BR><BR><BR>
