A satisfying slow flow listening to T.Rex's first album. This is a happy aslbum. I listewned to it alot 
when I was travelling earlier this year. Princeton, NYC. It holds good mmories. I made a lot of good memories this week, or I was very accomplished which makes me happy. So I should commemorate it with some happy music.

I opened a text document and brought my keyboard closer to me so I can slow flowI can stretch and write at the same time.

I wonder what elese I listened to when I was going thru that T.Rex phase. More happy music! This album is too short.

I just want to bend myself in half, backwards. That will relieve me of all the pain.
It has been a lot less severe latelyy. Should add that to my "recognistions page.
