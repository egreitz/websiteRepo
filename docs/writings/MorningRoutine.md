Morning Routine:
You wake up on the floor of a friend's office. There is no dedicated spot to place your specs while asleep. Sometimes they make it to some surface, most of the time they are hidden in the linens, or under your body. You pat down the shikibuton, writhing and worming your body so you can reach evey crevice and cranny without getting up. You find them, slightly misshapen and warm from spending the night under your ass. 
You check the time on you Sony Dream Machine AM/FM clock radio (ICF-C318) and recieve your first piece of information for the day. It's somewhere between 6:00am and 8:00am.
Your friend will enter the office around 9:00am, so you are sure to rise early.
Still lying, you slither closer to the  Broyhll Brasila nightstand you picked up from the thrift store for 7 bucks. It's towers over the bed. A big stretch is required to possibly reach something on the surface. That's fine, you love a big stretch. 
You begin to paw the tabletop, searching by touch for the earplug case and old person medicine organizer.
The pill organizer is felt first. You bring it down beside you and finally sit up.
Sunday to Sunday, AM and PM, pills pills pills. A couple to keep you stimulated, one for smoking cessation (you quit two weeks ago), and a couple multi-vitamin gummies (breakfast). First you fish out the two gummies and chew on those. You think about the first jar you purcahsed of these. They were a weird color and taste, but not weird enough to be offputting. You ate all the gummies in that jar, now you are on your second jar. These gummies are far more appitizing in color and flavor. You think of all the rancid multi-vitamins you've consumed in the last couple months. No bother though, because you are eating fresh gummies right now, and that's what matters here.
After chewing and contemplating, you invert the pill organizer over you palm. Three pills slide out. Without much hesitation, as you lift your palm to your mouth, you throw back your head. With you free hand (usually the right) you grope around for your Evian water bottle, which has become your new resuable water bottle, replacing the 
cumbersome black Hydroflask you found on the floor of the moving truck when you moved to the city.
You've convinced yourself, that you can convince yourself to drink more water, even tap, when it is disguised as your favorite water.
Sometime you find the bottle at the right moment as the pills fall into your mouth.
Head still back, you fill your mouth with water. You feel the pills floating around your tongue only for a moment before you take one large gulp.
Sometime you are a bit too late finding the water bottle. Sometime a pill get caught between your gums and cheek. Then you're left with a bitter taste in your mouth until you brush you teeth after selecting your outfit and taking a shower.
Either way, pleasant or not, the pills have been swallowed, signalling the start of your day.

Feet planted firmly on the ground, knees at eye level, you situate on to your sitbones and straighten up. Relaxing your shoulders you do a few odd stretches. Whatever feels good in that moment.
Once satisfied, you scoot closer to your knees pressing yours breasts against your thighs. Once situated you rise from the shikibuton taking care to not use your hands.
You've been working very hard on correcting your posture and moving with intention and grace.
No noises uttered when you rise. A fluid and contolled movement. You appriciate the odd things your body will do to satisfy your strange obessesions.

The thoughts begin. You want to focus on the task at hand. Now is not the time for creative think and considering. You need to shower and take care of a few things.
You overcorrect and spend to much time deciding your outfit.
You like to wear a long skirt on the days you intend to trapce around town. It's important to feel attractive (regardless if you truely are or not) and look presentable
when out and about. The city is your stage and youre walking around in circles on it. Like a tiger in a cage without enrichment.
Like when you played Zoo Tycoon with the dinosaur expansion pack. You would construct massive exhibits inahbited with a dozen or so t-rexes. They were never happy. The enclosure was too spacious.
Nevermind that, it didn't interfer with your ultimate goal. Dropping in random animals and watch them be hunted.
You love animals, but you were a very curious young girl then. You supposed eating the animals made the dinosaurs happy atleast.
So you would either do that, or make a few dozen dolphin exibits just to watch them. Any games with dolphins or horses fascinated you.
You will be seen, and you may see. So looking and feeling your best takes precedent. You choose your outfit carefully, even though you hate everything you own.
In the summer you wear volleyball like shorts under you skirts.
Its winter though, so you rummage through your stockpile of slips and hosery.
Go for the slip skirt if you'd like to wear a particular top.
If you decide to wear a short cardigan or large sweater, go for the slip dress. The slip dress will act as your top.
Today, you choose the slip skirt.
You pulled the trigger recently and purchased a few new bras in your "correct size" (it really wasn't, but you kept a couple that worked well enough).
You need to aclimate to "normal" bras. You've been wearing the same black mesh unlined wireless bra for ages. Its the only one you have and the company no longer produces them.
So you grab the slip skirt and bra from the undergarments box, black hose from the sock basket, and a pair of unflattering, but comfortable underwear from the underwear box.
Since you moved and now occupy a small corner of an office, you've had to alter the organization of your wardrobe.
You had to let go of many items during the move, but you brought a metal Ikea shelf with you.
At your old place, this shelf was full of books, nic-nacs, and Furbys. Reluctantly, the items that once lived on this shelf have been donated or sent back to the farm to be stored.
Now this shelf serves as a dresser. There is space for a couple Furbys, a few books, and a plant on the top shelf.
The second shelf is for pants and shirts. One shelf for everything, which you think should be even less than it is now.
Third shelf has recently become the undergarments shelf. You got into one of your organization tizzies and began rearanging your storage containers and pouches.
You consolidated enough for underwear, slips, and sock to each have their own box.
Prior to this every item was tossed in a basket on the floor of the closet.
The bottom shelf stores some of you art materials and a maneki-neko coin bank you picked up from the thrift store over a decade ago.
You grab a black mock neck top and head over to the closet.
Here hangs the rest of you wardrobe. You need to reorganize this, but as it stands, from leftto right we have
scarves, sweaters, cardigans, long sleeve blouses, short sleeve blouses, dresses, skirts, jackets, coats.
On the floor is a basket with belts, hats, and winter accessories.
All those long skirts you love to wear are here. The black 100% wool one is two sizes too big but has a lot of movement and volume.
The black nylon and acetate skirt used to be two sizes too small, and you would still stuff yourself into it and be uncomforatble all day. Lucky, it now fits just right.
The polyester lining is abhorent. The seam has split down the back from the stuffing. You've been meaning to fix this, but you also want to rip it out because you loath polyester.
The last skirt is a long green floral skirt. This one has a slit in the back. Your slip peaks out from under. Your elaborate undergaments causes you to feel particularly alluring.
Even though you appriciate a bit of modesty in you attire, you like it when your slip peaks out from under your skirt.
So you select this skirt, the green floral with the slit in the back the reveals a bit of your undegarments.
With outfit in hand, you head off to take a shower.
