The Terminator - December 5, 2025
Full frontal Arnie 5 minutes in made me say "Oh my." I was happy just to see his backside and then they gimme a treat.
"I'd Die for John Connor"
Kyle looks like Napoleon Dynamite
Boppin' soundtrack. Listened to it on my walk to the Asian market today.
I think it half passes the Bechdel Test. Can't remember if the girls converse about something other than men. i don't think so...
Nude Arnie
I like big killing machines
Sex scene was tasteful
Arnie on a motorcycle
Maladaptive dreaming I'm Sarah Connor now.
Kyle flipping all the switches in the factory was amusing
<3 the cyborg
Badass pregnant woman
I love Sarah Connor
What's the word to describe the feeling of sadness from living 33 years and never watching this movie til yesterday?
