                            <p>Spent much of my time at the bar scrolling through the items I've saved from the web. A good reminder of the interests I wanted to persue at some point. Trying to figure out how to get these files on to my desktop. Some are full texts on my phone that I would like to read.</p>
                            <p>I reread "Lonliness" from <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> last night while out. That was a nice treat. I'd like to reread that entire book. I gave my copy to the man who loaned <i>Secret Rendezvous</i> to me.</p>
                            <p> I think it's a Pink Floyd and T. Rex kind of day.
                            </p>
                            <p>I want to share my git repo so you can see the backend insanity, but it would dox me...kind of. Maybe I'll create a new account or stop caring about doxxing.</p>
                            <p>I also want to reread <i>Of Human Bondage</i>. Certain that the book reeks of cigarette smoke. I smoked and read quite a bit and I do miss it. I could make it a seasonal thing, or just smoke more weed.</p>
                            <p><q>It's no good crying over spilt milk, because all the forces of the universe were bent on spilling it.</q></p>
                            <p><cite>-W. Somerset Maugham, Of Human Bondage</cite></p>
                            <p>Scheduled daily updates at 00:00.</p>
                            <p>please work</p>

                            <h3>1:26pm</h3>
                            <p>Finished redesigning page layouts. Doesn't look much different, and still needs some tweaks (gallery pages), but it's good enough to push. It should make future designing simpler.</p>

                            <h3>2:25pm</h3>
                            <p>I need to spellcheck this whole site. Once my hands warm up more. </p>
                            <figure>
                            <img src="images/baltimore/PXL_20251211_191211517.jpg">

                            </figure>
                            <p>I have lots to write about now, but I worry my keyboard gets annoying to listen to. So I try to keep typing to a minimum when people are around.</p>
                            <p>A cold walk gets the ideas flowing. And this time I didn't forget! I've learned I forget if I can't write it down in time. Lost many A+ ideas that way. But not this time!</p>
                            <p>As my thoughts progessed and became more complex, I repeated a one word descriptor for each thought: "clouds, music, art, pederast." I know. I'll expand on it tonight. Hopefully these words are enough to keep the idea alive. Probably aren't.
                            I'll move to pen and paper.</p>
                            <p> the figcaption tag makes me think about figs.</p>
                            <h3>10:32pm</h3>
                            <p>I should push this code. I should do more debugging before I push. I should secdule automatic pushes. I don't know if I am using the correct jargon.</p>
                            <p>Never got around to spellchecking. Maybe there is a prize if you find them all.</p>
                            <p> The bar was boring after Bruce left. I appreciate his company. I would have been real bored, or left earlier. I like hearing his stories. I wish I could preserve them. He has lived a very beautiful life. I try to capture his perceptions, and his digressions are wonderful.</p>
                            <p>All that to say, I did a lot of writing. I approached the edge of the "texting some guy" cliff, but didn't jump. Bus arrived before I could make a decision. Thanks bus, i am glad I came home.</p>
                            
                            <p>Stretch and study was the plan, but I am exhausted. I walked a lot today. I need to get to bed earlier, but I get so wrapped up in something...like this site. Exactly what I am doing now.</p>

                            <p> I expanded on the "clouds music art pederast" thing in a journal, and I do not feel like typing it. Maybe I will post photos of the entry. You can check out my handwriting.</p>

                            <p>I think that second drink I had is hitting me hard. Bartender was practicing a new cocktail. Eggnog flavor. It was a large drink wwith very little eggnog and a lot of liquor. Gonna pass out now.</p>

                            <h3>11:38pm</h3>
                            <p>Spent 9 hours working the site. If you're reading this, then it should look good. Hopefully you didn't access this log via direct URL. You saw a mess.</p>
                            <p>Haven't been in the  mood to log. I've been mulling over the feeling I get when men think I am 25. A bit foul when they are 10 years older than you and you've been intimate before he knew your age. This guy believed I was 20 years younger than him and still persued. Maybe it was innocent, or an attempt to flatter. Makes my skin crawl. I try not to think that uncovering my true age would repel. Bullet dodged if it does.</p>
                            <p>Genetics are on my side, and I feel I dress young for my age. I have a particular style I like, and that happens to include vintage My Little Pony and Sesame Street shirts.</p>
                            <p>Rearranged my "room." I should really stop describing it as "sleeping on my friend's office floor." I should snap a photo of my space. I am failing to describe it in a way that doesn't garner puzzled looks. Probably adds to the issue of people thinking I am in my 20s.</p>

                            <p>Resisting the urge to redesign using pre-made templates. They are attractive, but it's nice to say that I made this completely from scratch.</p>
                            <p>Still working on gallery pages. My b&w film photography is pretty bad. Collages are a little nicer. Someone called this site "art." So I am doing something right.</p>
                            <p>I want a Diet Coke</p>
                            <p>Made ramen yesterday. Looks like this ramen I made a few years ago for NYE:
                                <img src="images/film/thumbnails/thumb_RamenNewYears.jpg"></p>
                                <p> This main div is too tiny, but I am not ready to resize everything...again ;-;</p>
                                <p>I stopped taking stimmies last week. Although I shouldn't be, I am surprised by the improvement in my physical health. Mental is...alright. Difficult to mustard the initial push to get started on a task.</p>
                                <p><a href="photography.html">Photography</a> and <a href="collage.html">collage</a> pages are "up." Just thumbnails at this point, but it's something new to look at. Navigate to the pages via the <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> page.</p>
                                <p>Watched the mystery blank VHS tape a friend gave to me. The only thing of any interest was the 1994 toy commercials</p>

                                <p>And now I want to add <a href="https://www.ebay.com/b/Fairy-Winkles/262346/bn_7023398788">Fairy Winkles</a> to my toy collection. &hearts;They are so cute!&hearts;</p>
                                <p>I think I am past due for a heart spilling post. Maybe after my walk today. If not, then surely tomorrow.</p>
                                <h3>1:35pm</h3>
                                <p> Listening to Refused.</p>
                                <p> Brainstorming ideas for an encrypted page. I'll have to put most of my other projects on hold if I go with the idea I like atm. I'll have to do research and playtesting.</p>

                                <p>Need to stop pushing updates multiple times a day. I need to wait til the end of the day to push. I get anxious thinking people actually check this.</p>

                                <p><a href="collage.html">Collage gallery is done!</a> (click the thumbnails to view larger image.) I had to do some crazy coding to get it to work. I am very proud of it &#9786;</p>

                            <h3>5:34pm</h3>
                            <p>Been keeping up with this, a bit.
                                 Working on some gallery pages. Nearly ready. I'm learning Git so I can specify which updates to push. I don't want to push the gallery pages yet, but want to continue logging.</p>
                                 <p>Killing time til movie night at a friends.</p>
                                 <p>Went out late Thursday. It was amusing. There was a terrible amount of people present for the monument lighting. I set out with hopes of hot cocoa, Carol of the Bells, and a moment of contemplation. That didn't happen because of the aformentioned amount of people.</p>
                                 <p> I saw the fireworks for the first time. Last year was less crowded, and much colder. A brief ideal for me, but the cold was too much and I went home early. The year before, a friend was in town and had an upset tummy. So I kept him company instead.</p>
                                 <p>It was pretty.</p>
                                 <p> I overstayed at the bar. It was nice to see everyone and hand out crocheted snowflakes. A stranger lauded my performance in Rosemary's Baby. My first Mia Farrow compliment &hearts; &hearts; (I forgot all about html emojis&hearts;)</p>
                                 <p>I obliged two too many drink offers from men. One man got very drunk and began speaking salaciously. Any goodwill that man forged with me has dissolved. Fortunately, the man on my left captured my attention and got me out of there.</p>
                                 <p> Unfortunately, I was quite out of sorts yesterday. Went for a walk and watched The Terminator.</p>
                                 <p> I've killed too much time and may arrive late to the function. I would rather stay in and detail my thoughts on The Terminator, but that shall wait until I return.</p>
                                 <h3>9:44pm</h3>
                                 <p>Bailed on the movie night. No cheap or safe routes to his place.</p>
                                 <p>Now I can write up those Terminator thoughts...and eat pudding. Also spent like an hour shaving. Let myself go there. And now things are happening when I least expect it. I can raise my expectations a bit now. I'll come to reasonable expectations eventually.</p>
                                 <p>I watched the Kate Bush Christmas Special. Really makes me want to dance. I think the art of dance insists on the self too much. Ask me about it sometime.</p>
                                 <p>Adam Sandler baffles me. He's both improved and worsened my fascination with Snack Pack. I wish I never watched Billy Madison.</p>
                                 <p>This the closest I will get to segue into The Terminator review:</p>

                        <p>Youtube analyzed all your data and created a 2025 recap. You listened to Gaucho by Steely Dan 44 times this year. Probably more since the bartender has dubbed this your theme song and can often be heard throughout the bar.
                            Kate Bush was your most listened to artist. Steely Dan came in second.</p>
                            <p>I kept my own <a href="python/test/example.txt">book and music log</a> for a few months this year. Intending to create a recap without sacrficing my personal data. But I did not keep up with it. Here are the books I read this year (doubt I will finish <i> The Counterfeiters</i> by  the end of the year):</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Frankenstein</li>

                                <li>Ficciones</li>
                                <li>Cat's Cradle</li>
                                <li>Siren's of Titan</li>
                                <li>The Woman in the Dunes</li>
                                <li>To the Lighthouse</li>

                            <p> Doesn't feel like much, but there are a few books I began and never finished.</p>

                                    <p>Site's one year anniversary is coming up. I plan to finish out this year in first person, and start the new year in second person. Perhaps move to third person in the third year. First person is exhausting and cringe.
                                        I would like to write as an omnipresent being observing my life. Explore myself and adventures from an external perspective.</p>
                                    <p>Up next is an image gallery</p>
                                    <p>Watched Urban Cowboy. It was fine. I like watching Travolta films just to observe his mannerisms.</p>
                                    <p>Back in Ohio, there is a small vintage shop. It's been around for many years, and I have spent much time there during those years. It's first location was right downtown. In middle school my best friend and I would walk over after school to browse. One day I forgot to meet my little brother outside his first grade room. Among the items in the store were old school posters. I bought a George Harrison one. I also bought a Saturday Night Fever era John Travolta poster. It hung on the wall at the foot of my bed, and then above my bed. He didn't last long up there, but it was entertaining.</p>
                                    <p>My much younger brother had a Grease fascination in preschool. That movie on repeat on repeat in our home.</p>
                                    <p> My intentions were spoiled by the rain. I'll try again tomorrow</p>
